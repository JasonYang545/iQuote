# About the project
Quotes, you see them everywhere and the right one at the right time is just as good as a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è . I built this project because quotes from the people I've encountered in my life and those I look up to constantly humbles and inspires me to work harder and accomplish my goals. I wanted a way to keep my favorite quotes close to me and what better way than to build a mobile app! <br>
Let's go through the User Experience, User Interface, and features of iQuote! <br> <br>
**Disclaimer** All demos below feature red oval highlight over the time. This is not part of iQuote, but indication of screen recording as deployment and testing of iQuote was executed on a physical iphone XS MAX. <br>
<br>

# Overview
## Startup and Privacy Consent
<img src="Startup_PrivacyConsent.gif" width="300" height="648.5"/>  <br>
After download and startup of iQuote, the user is greeted with the text *"work harder üê¢ "* while iQuote loads and launches its home screen. With a first download, iQuote asks for push notification permission. Allowing push notifications enables iQuote's feature that sends a quote as push notification to the device outside iQuote's environment at a user-desired time (I set my quote notification for when I wake up).  <br>
**Note:** Push notification consent is only prompted once after initial download and notification settings are configurable in device settings. <br>
<br>

## Quote of The Day

Like many things in life such as songs, we can resonate with and become attached to quotes and revisit them many times. With iQuote, you can save those quotes you love to a *Favorites* list by simply *tapping* the ‚ù§Ô∏è -icon that accompanies each quote. Access this *Favorites* list by going to *Quote List* and sliding the *Show Favorites Only* to view only your favorites. summary of this feature listed below:
- **‚ù§Ô∏è :** Quote is labelled as a favorite and will be featured in *Show Favorites Only* list
- **‚ô° :** Quote is not labelled as a favorite and can be found in the general *Quote List*
- **Show Favorites Only:** When toggled on (green), iQuote only displays favorited quotes. When toggled off, iQuote displays all quotes.
