# About the project
Quotes, you see them everywhere and the right one at the right time is just as good as a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è . I built this project because quotes from the people I've encountered in my life and those I look up to constantly humbles and inspires me to work harder and accomplish my goals. I wanted a way to keep my favorite quotes close to me and what better way than to build a mobile app! <br>
Let's go through the User Experience, User Interface, and features of iQuote! <br>

# Overview
## Startup and Privacy Consent

After download and startup of iQuote, the user is greeted with the text *"work harder üê¢ "* while iQuote loads and launches its home screen. With a first download, iQuote asks for push notification permission. Allowing push notifications enables iQuote's feature that sends a quote as push notification to the device outside iQuote's environment at a user-desired time (I set my quote notification for when I wake up).  <br>
**Note:** Push notification consent is only prompted once after initial download and notification settings are configurable in device settings. 

## Quote of The Day

When the user opens iQuote, iQuote launcnhes Quote of The Day that displays a randomly selected quote and accompanying deatils. The quote's **author, picture of author, author occupation, quote** are presented in a clean interface using VStack embedded within a NavigationView. 
- **TAP:** Want another quote? Simply ***tap*** anywhere on the screen to generate a new quote üòÆ . 
- **‚ù§Ô∏è :** ***tap*** the ‚ù§Ô∏è to favorite the quote and save to Favorites. This feature allows user to save their favorite quotes and easily access their favorites (demo shown below). 

## Quote List
